        Hello, I'm Swaroop Kumar, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering. I have a passion for technology and have been fortunate to develop a diverse skill set, which includes proficiency in languages like C++, React.js, React Native, GitHub, SQL, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.

I've had the opportunity to work on several projects that have honed my technical abilities. For instance, I created a website called "Weather Bank," where users can access weather information for different cities, including temperature, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also developed an app, "NSS APP," using the React Native and MERN stack, which helps in managing volunteer information, event details, photos, and documents. It also features a QR code-based attendance system, making event management more efficient.

Furthermore, I created a personal project known as "Mark45," an AI assistant built using Python. This assistant can perform various tasks through voice commands, such as web searches, system operations like shutdown and restart, fetching information from Wikipedia, sending emails, taking screenshots, and even telling jokes. It's designed to simplify everyday tasks through voice interaction.

In addition to my academic and technical pursuits, I gained valuable industry experience during a 6-month internship as a React Native FrontEnd Developer at Meld. During my internship, I worked with React Native and Firebase, handling the front-end framework, resolving technical issues like API integration, and ensuring that data was stored correctly in the backend.

I've also achieved some notable accomplishments, such as receiving the Pratibha Award for my outstanding performance in the 10th board examinations. I've also taken on leadership roles, serving as the Vice President of the National Service Scheme (NSS) Club at my college. Furthermore, I led a team that secured the 1st position in a UI/UX design contest during our college's cultural fest and annual day.

In summary, my journey in technology and my dedication to learning and innovation have shaped me into a well-rounded individual. I'm excited to continue my growth and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact.
